#  Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring

This project assigns a **credit score (0â€“1000)** to wallets interacting with the Aave V2 protocol based on their historical transaction behavior.

Higher scores indicate reliable and responsible usage, while lower scores reflect risky, bot-like, or exploitative behavior.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Place your transaction JSON file (e.g., `user-wallet-transactions.json`) in your working directory.
2. Open `Wallet_Scores.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to:
   - Extract features
   - Train the model
   - Predict wallet scores
4. Output:
   - `wallet_scores.csv` containing wallet addresses, predicted scores, and categories.

## ðŸ“‚ Outputs

- **wallet_scores.csv**: Wallets with predicted credit scores and classifications.
- **Score Distribution Graph:** Shows how wallet scores are spread across ranges.

##  Extensibility

This project can be extended by:
- Using real labeled data for supervised learning.
- Adding more on-chain behavior features and protocol usage patterns.
